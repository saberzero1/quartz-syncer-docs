> [!INFO] Expired authentication token?
> The most frequent issue with authentication is an expired access token. You can check this in the Quartz Syncer settings inside Obsidian (`Settings > Community Plugins > Quartz Syncer`).
>
> If you see an authentication error, regenerate your access token following the guide for your Git provider:
> - [[Guides/GitHub Setup#Generate an Access Token\|GitHub]]
> - [[Guides/GitLab Setup#Generate an Access Token\|GitLab]]
> - [[Guides/Bitbucket Setup#Generate an App Password\|Bitbucket]]

## My Authentication Token is correct, but I get an error when publishing

Please ensure you have the proper rights to your Quartz repository. Your token needs write access to the repository.

## Connection issues

If you're on a university network, corporate network, or similar shared network, your connection to the Git provider might be blocked or rate-limited. Try:

1. Using a different network (e.g., mobile hotspot)
2. Configuring a [[Settings/Git/CORS Proxy]] if required by your network

## I have a different issue not listed here

Please raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-syncer/issues).
