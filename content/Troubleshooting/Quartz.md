## Can I use an Obsidian Theme in Quartz?

See [[Using an Obsidian theme in Quartz]].

## What theme is this site using?

[Catppuccin Macchiato](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-themes), installed as a Quartz v5 community plugin. See [[Using an Obsidian theme in Quartz]] for setup instructions.

## Can I configure Quartz settings from Obsidian using Quartz Syncer?

Yes. Quartz Syncer can read and update `quartz.config.yaml` directly:

- **From the UI**: Use the **Quartz** tab in Quartz Syncer's settings to edit site-wide options like page title, base URL, theme, and locale.
- **From the CLI**: Use the `quartz-syncer:quartz-config` command to read or update configuration values. See the [[Guides/CLI|CLI guide]] for details.
- **Plugin management**: Use the `quartz-syncer:plugin` command to list, add, remove, and update Quartz v5 plugins. See the [[Guides/CLI|CLI guide]] for details.

## Quartz plugins fail to build on a fresh clone

On a brand-new clone, `npx quartz plugin install` may report a handful of plugins failing to build. This happens because `quartz.lock.json` pins each plugin to a specific commit, and those older commits may have been authored against earlier versions of `@quartz-community/types` / `@quartz-community/utils` whose built output is no longer available.

Fix it by refreshing all plugins to their latest versions:

```bash
npx quartz plugin install --latest
```

This rewrites `quartz.lock.json` with the newest commits and rebuilds every plugin from scratch. Subsequent `npx quartz plugin install` calls will restore cleanly from the refreshed lockfile.

> [!TIP] Most community plugins now ship pre-built
> Most community plugins now include a pre-built `dist/` directory, skipping the build step entirely. This issue mainly applies to plugins in development or older plugins that haven't adopted pre-built distribution.

## Plugin install hangs or fails on low-end hardware or CI

By default, `npx quartz plugin install` clones and builds plugins in parallel across all CPU cores. On memory-constrained environments (CI runners, low-end laptops, Raspberry Pi, small VPS instances) this can exhaust RAM or cause the process to hang.

Lower the parallelism with the `--concurrency` / `-c` flag:

```bash
# Install one plugin at a time (safest, slowest)
npx quartz plugin install --latest -c 1

# Two at a time — usually works on 4 GB machines
npx quartz plugin install --latest --concurrency 2
```

The same flag works for `plugin add`:

```bash
npx quartz plugin add github:quartz-community/some-plugin -c 1
```
