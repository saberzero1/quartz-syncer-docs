## Can I use an Obsidian Theme in Quartz?

See [[Using an Obsidian theme in Quartz]].

## What theme is this site using?

[Catppuccin Macchiato](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-themes), installed as a Quartz v5 community plugin. See [[Using an Obsidian theme in Quartz]] for setup instructions.

## Can I configure Quartz settings from Obsidian using Quartz Syncer?

Yes. Quartz Syncer can read and update `quartz.config.yaml` directly:

- **From the UI**: Use the **Quartz** tab in Quartz Syncer's settings to edit site-wide options like page title, base URL, theme, and locale.
- **From the CLI**: Use the `quartz-syncer:quartz-config` command to read or update configuration values. See the [[Guides/CLI|CLI guide]] for details.
- **Plugin management**: Use the `quartz-syncer:plugin` command to list, add, remove, and update Quartz v5 plugins. See the [[Guides/CLI|CLI guide]] for details.

## I have a different issue not listed here

Please raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-syncer/issues).
