## Releases

### Version 1.11.1

- Fixed Obsidian styled comments breaking parsing.

### Version 1.11.0

- Migrated compiler pipeline from regex-based transforms to AST-based transforms using [`remark-obsidian`](https://github.com/quartz-community/remark-obsidian).
  - Obsidian comments (`%% ... %%`) are now stripped via AST instead of regex, correctly handling comments inside code blocks.
  - Vault path stripping for links and images is now handled via AST node visitors.
  - Wikilink pipe characters (`|`) inside table rows are automatically escaped for Quartz GFM compatibility.
  - Callout syntax (`> [!INFO]`) is preserved correctly through the AST round-trip.
- Delegated rendering transforms to Quartz v5's build pipeline.
  - Wikilink resolution, transclusion expansion, SVG inlining, highlight syntax, and tag rendering are now handled by Quartz.
  - Compiler pipeline reduced from 8 steps to 4: frontmatter enrichment, integration pre-compilation, link targeting, and AST transform.
  - Compiler reduced from ~900 lines to ~500 lines.
- Fixed image embeds blending with surrounding text when preceded by other content.
- Removed transclusion and SVG embedding logic (now handled by Quartz v5).
- Removed publish file cache system (`cacheFilesMarkedForPublishing`, `clearPublishCache`).
- Simplified `SyncerPageCompiler` constructor (removed `getFilesMarkedForPublishing` parameter).
- Removed dead settings: `applyEmbeds` (unused after Phase 3) and `pathRewriteRules` (never read by runtime code). Removed "Apply embeds" toggle from Quartz settings panel.
- Simplified Excalidraw integration to pass-through (push files only, Quartz v5 handles rendering). Removed SVG conversion, SCSS styles, and ExcalidrawAutomate dependency.
- Split Git connection status into separate read and write access checks. The settings panel now shows `(read: ok/failed)` and `(write: ok/failed)` independently, correctly identifying when a repository URL is valid but credentials lack push access.
- Fixed canvas `extractBlobLinks` to only collect asset files (images, fonts, etc.) instead of all file nodes including markdown notes.

### Version 1.10.1

- Fixed `tag`, `alias`, and `cssclass` compatibility handling for Quartz v5.

### Version 1.10.0

- Added support for publishing Obsidian Bases, as Quartz v5 supports it.
- Added support for publishing Obsidian Canvas, as Quartz v5 supports it.
- Significant performance improvements.
- Improved progress indicators.

### Version 1.9.2

- Added support for [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) drawings.
  - Excalidraw files (`.excalidraw.md`) are automatically converted to embedded SVG images.
  - Embedded drawings (`![[Example.excalidraw]]`) are supported.
  - Both light and dark theme variants are generated for proper theme support.
  - Uses the [ExcalidrawAutomate API](https://excalidraw-obsidian.online) for reliable SVG export.
- Improved [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) integration.
  - Updated styles to match the plugin's Svelte component styling.
  - Added complete CSS variable support for theming.
- Improved [Datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore) integration.
  - Updated styles with complete CSS from the plugin source (cards, tables, callouts, paging, embeds, errors, and layout).
- Refactored plugin integration architecture for improved maintainability.
  - All integrations now use a unified `PluginIntegration` interface.
  - Integration styles are automatically managed via SCSS files in `quartz/styles/syncer/`.
- Added new setting: **Manage integration styles** (enabled by default).
  - When enabled, Quartz Syncer automatically writes integration styles to your Quartz repository.
  - Styles are written to `quartz/styles/syncer/` with automatic `custom.scss` import management.
  - Syncer import is added after `@use "./base.scss"` to ensure proper style ordering.
  - Disabling this setting will clean up syncer styles on next publish.
- Updated documentation.

### Version 1.9.1

- Added secure token storage using Obsidian's [SecretStorage API](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/TypeScript+API/SecretStorage).
  - Authentication tokens are now stored securely using the platform's native secret storage (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux).
  - Tokens are no longer stored in `data.json`, preventing accidental exposure when syncing vaults.
  - Existing tokens are automatically migrated to secure storage on plugin load.
  - New password-style input with visibility toggle in Git settings.
  - Requires Obsidian 1.11.4 or later.
- Added configurable frontmatter output format setting.
  - YAML format is now the default (more readable and standard for static site generators).
  - JSON format available as an option for backwards compatibility.
  - Configurable in Settings > Note properties (frontmatter).
- Improved diff view styling.

### Version 1.9.0

- Replaced Octokit-based implementation with Isomorphic Git-based implementation.
  - This change resolves a few longstanding issues, as well as address a few frequent requests:
    - No longer dependent on Octokit, and therefore GitHub as Git host.
    - Significant performance improvements.
    - No longer suffers from GitHub API rate limits, mostly due to direct Git calls.
      - Please let us know if you still run into issue regarding rate limits.
- Added support for GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Codeberg, and Self-hosted instances.
- Added new diff viewer in the Publication Center.
  - Split view (side-by-side comparison) and Unified view options.
  - Configurable default view style in Settings > UI.
  - Responsive design: defaults to split view on desktop, unified view on mobile.
  - Synced scrolling between panes in split view.
- Improved cache invalidation for dynamic content.
  - Files containing Dataview or Datacore queries are now automatically detected.
  - Dynamic files always recompile to ensure query results are up-to-date.
  - Hash comparison determines if output actually changed, preventing unnecessary updates.
- Added UI settings tab for configuring user interface preferences.
- Updated documentation.

### Version 1.8.10

- Fixed publication center showing files outside configured root as publishable.
- Extended test set.

- Updated documentation.

### Version 1.8.6

  - Persist cache: whether to keep the cache in the localStorage when the plugin unloads. This is only recommended for users that start Obsidian with plugins disabled, such as when using the [Lazy Plugins](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins) plugin. Defaults to false.
  - Clear cache: Clears the cache when pressed.

- Visual indicators for loading and publishing.

  - The key should be a boolean/Checkbox (source mode/live-preview mode respectively.)
- Added Obsidian commands for modifying a note's publication status:
  - `Quartz Syncer: Add publish flag`: adds the specified publish flag to the current note frontmatter if not already present and sets it to `true`. This exposes the note to Quartz Syncer.
