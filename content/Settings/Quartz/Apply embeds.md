When enabled, embed links are handled by Quartz Syncer.

## Recommended configuration

This setting should be **Enabled** if:

- You want to embed (parts of) non-published notes inside published notes.
- You don't want embedded content to be a separate page.
- You don't want links to the original content next to your embeddings.
- Your notes are composed mostly of embed, and you want clean pages instead of many links.

This setting should be **Disabled** if:

- You want to include embedded content as separate pages as well.
- You want to prevent accidentally embedding private content. (Embedding a non-published note will result in a broken in link in Quartz, instead of embedded content.)
- You have implemented custom logic for embedding in Quartz that requires embed links to be passed to Quartz.
